# CS-425-Real-Estate-Management-Project

This project is a PostgreSQL-based Real Estate Management System designed to manage users, agents, renters, properties, and bookings. The database enforces core business rules using foreign key constraints, ENUM types, and triggers to maintain data integrity.

A Python command-line application provides a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the database. Through this interface, users can view property listings, browse renters, and create bookings. Booking availability is enforced at the database level to prevent invalid reservations.

The system demonstrates the integration of:

Relational database design

SQL schema creation and data integrity constraints

Python application development using psycopg2

A menu-driven command-line user interface

This project was developed as part of a database systems course to showcase end-to-end database-backed application development.
